# pylorant
some features for the valo client using the api

# information
  ## To optimize user experience, it is highly recommended to initiate Valorant prior to launching Pylorant.

  - use name reveal only when in game (not while in loadscreen)

  Auto Lock: before queueing -> select your agent -> check the auto lock checkbox -> and queue.
            This has to be done after every game cuz checking all the time would rate limit the api

# Requirements
  [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.12 (older versions 3.10 etc should work)
  
  -> run requirements.bat
