	- lock agents (adjustable delay)
	- name reveal  (only use ingame! not while in loading screen)
	- friends tab \ invite all button 

# information
  ## To optimize user experience, it is highly recommended to initiate Valorant prior to launching Pylorant.

  Auto Lock: before queueing -> select your agent -> check the auto lock checkbox -> and queue.
            This has to be done after every game cuz checking all the time would rate limit the api
