# pylorant
PYQT5 GUI with features for the valo client using the api

# Features

- [x] Dodge button (dodge agent select \ no restart needed)
- [x] name reveal (only use ingame! not while in loading screen)
- [x] friends tab \ invite all button 
- [] loadout

# Information
  ## To optimize user experience, it is highly recommended to initiate Valorant prior to launching Pylorant.

  Auto Lock: before queueing -> select your agent -> check the auto lock checkbox -> and queue.
            This has to be done after every game cuz checking all the time would rate limit the api

 > [!NOTE]
 > Itâ€™s prudent to presume the existence of glitches in the software script

# Requirements
  [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.12 (older versions 3.10 etc should work aswell)

  -> Code->Download zip->extract
    
  -> run requirements.bat
  
  -> start Valorant
  
  -> start valoclient.py

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Try to avoid using api calls while in loading screen stages otherwise long loading screens may occur
